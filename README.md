## 🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard is a **proof-of-concept security research tool** built to:
- Demonstrate API security testing methodologies
- Document Vaunt API capabilities and limitations
- Test for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities
- Analyze authentication and authorization controls
- Display flight information and waitlist data

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is for security research and educational purposes only.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Click "Run" to start the development server
   - Dashboard will open automatically in the webview

2. **Select Account**
   - Choose between Sameer Chopra (Cabin+) or Ashley Rager (Free)
   - Each account has different tier privileges

3. **Pull Live Data**
   - Click "Pull Live Data" to fetch current flight information
   - View waitlist entries and flight details

4. **View User Details**
   - Click on any name in waitlist tables to see available user information
   - Limited to public entrant data (no full PII access)

| **[SQL_SMS_SECURITY_REPORT.md](SQL_SMS_SECURITY_REPORT.md)** | 🔴 **SQL injection & SMS security vulnerabilities** | **Nov 5, 2025** |
| [SECURITY_TEST_RESULTS.md](SECURITY_TEST_RESULTS.md) | ✅ Comprehensive API security testing results | Nov 5, 2025 |
| [SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md](SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md) | Mobile app decompilation & vulnerability analysis | Nov 3, 2025 |
| [API_EXPLOITATION_GUIDE.md](API_EXPLOITATION_GUIDE.md) | API endpoint documentation & usage patterns | Oct 2024 |
| [DUFFEL_BOOKING_ANALYSIS.md](DUFFEL_BOOKING_ANALYSIS.md) | Duffel booking integration analysis | Oct 2024 |

### Key Findings

**🔴 SMS Authentication: CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES** ⚠️ **NEW**
- NO rate limiting on SMS requests (SMS bombing possible)
- NO rate limiting on code verification (account takeover via brute force)
- User enumeration possible (registered vs unregistered numbers)
- See [SQL_SMS_SECURITY_REPORT.md](SQL_SMS_SECURITY_REPORT.md) for details

**🟡 SQL Injection: LOW-MEDIUM RISK** ⚠️ **NEW**
- Most endpoints properly protected
- Potential issue: 500 errors in `completeSignIn` phoneNumber field
- No data exfiltration possible

**✅ API Authorization: GOOD**
- No IDOR vulnerabilities found
- Authorization controls working correctly
- Users can only access own data

**🟡 Privacy Concern: MINOR**
- Flight waitlist data exposes user names and positions
- No email/phone/address exposure via API

**❌ Mobile App: HIGH RISK**
- Client-side data manipulation possible
- See SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md for details

## 🧪 Security Testing Performed

### 1. Authentication Testing ✅
- ✅ SMS-based JWT token generation
- ✅ Payload injection attempts (userId, admin flags)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Token bypass attempts

**Result:** All authentication vulnerabilities blocked.

### 2. IDOR Testing ✅
- ✅ User PII access attempts (`/v1/user/:userId`)
- ✅ Entrant data access (`/v1/entrant/:entrantId`)
- ✅ Cross-user data queries
- ✅ Unauthorized profile access

**Result:** No IDOR vulnerabilities found. All blocked with 404.

### 3. Waitlist Manipulation ✅
- ✅ Join waitlist endpoints (all return 404)
- ✅ Remove from waitlist (all return 404)
- ✅ Cross-user waitlist manipulation

**Result:** All manipulation endpoints disabled or non-existent.

## 🔍 What the Dashboard Shows

### ✅ Data Accessible
- Your own complete user profile (email, phone, subscription)
- All flights with departure/arrival details
- Waitlist entrant data for all flights:
  - First name, last name
  - Queue position
  - Carbon offset enrollment
  - Referral count

### ❌ Data NOT Accessible
- Other users' email addresses
- Other users' phone numbers
- Other users' addresses
- Other users' payment information
- Ability to join/leave waitlists (API endpoints disabled)

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **HTTP Client:** Fetch API
- **Authentication:** Hardcoded JWT tokens (for research only)
- **API:** Vaunt API (https://vauntapi.flyvaunt.com)

## 📊 API Endpoints Tested

### ✅ Working Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/v1/auth/initiateSignIn` | POST | No | Trigger SMS code |
| `/v1/auth/completeSignIn` | POST | No | Get JWT token |
| `/v1/user` | GET | Yes | Get own profile |
| `/v1/flight` | GET | Yes | List all flights |
| `/v1/flight/:id` | GET | Yes | Get flight details |

### ❌ Non-Existent Endpoints (404)
- `/v1/user/:userId` - Direct user access
- `/v1/entrant/:entrantId` - Direct entrant access
- `/v1/waitlist/join` - Join waitlist
- `/v1/waitlist/remove` - Remove from waitlist
- All other IDOR-vulnerable endpoints

See [SECURITY_TEST_RESULTS.md](SECURITY_TEST_RESULTS.md) for complete endpoint inventory.
